# ðŸš€ HPC Project: Background Subtraction (Sequential, OpenMP, MPI)

## ðŸŸ¢ Project Description

This project implements **Background Subtraction** using three different approaches:
1. **Sequential (Single-threaded CPU approach)**
2. **OpenMP (Shared Memory Parallelism)**
3. **MPI (Message Passing Interface for Distributed Memory Parallelism)**

The purpose of the project is to compare the performance of these approaches for estimating background images and generating foreground masks from a video input.
